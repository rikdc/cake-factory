# Factory for CakePHP

## Installation

Clone the application inside your Plugins folder

	$ git clone https://github.com/jaggyspaghetti/cake-factory.git Factory
	
Load it and make sure you read the Plugin's bootstrap folder. Append this to your `Config/bootstrap.php`:

	CakePlugin::load( 'Factory', array('bootstrap' => true) );
	

## Settings

The default location of your factories in the bootstrap here `Plugin/Factory/Config/bootstrap.php`

	define( 'FACTORY', ROOT . DS . APP_DIR . DS . 'Test' . DS . 'Factory' );


## Usage


### build( [ $attributes = array() ] )

This builds your JSON file into an object and returns a Cake `Model` object

    $factory = new Factory( 'user' );
    $factory->build()->save();
   
You can override the attributes so you can test validation
    
    $factory = new Factory( 'user' );
    $factory->build(array( 'username' => null ))->validates();

### validates( [ $attributes = array() ] )

I found that I use this a lot so I just made it a function.

    $factory = new Factory( 'user' );
    $factory->validates(array( 'username' => null )); # true or false

### create( [array $attributes] );
 
Create while skipping validations

    $factory = new Factory( 'user' );
    $factory->create();
 
### populate( [ $count = 5 ], [ $attributes = array() ] )

Populates the database.

    $factory = new Factory( 'user' );
    $factory->populate( 20 );

## Creating Factories

You can create your factories by default inside your `Test/Factory/`. Name it with `ModelName.json`

So, if you have a user that's related to a roles file, you'll have files `User.json` and `Role.json`


### Role.json

	{
		"name": "Administrator"
		"description": "Access to anything and everything"
	}
	
### User

	{
		"username": "username#{n}",
		"password": "a valid password",
		"password_confirmation": "a valid password"
	}
	
	
## Notes

### Creating counters

Just add `#{n}` inside and it'll be the counter for unique stuff

### Associating Factories

Added this just in case custom relations are used

	"role_id": {
		"model": "Role"
	}
	
### Overriding Association Values

You can see above, but wait, YOU CAN NEST IT!

	"user_id": {
		"model": "User",
		"attributes": {
			
			"role_id": {
				"model": "Role",
				"attributes": { "name": "Standard" }
			}
			
		}
	}
	
## Testing

Now I tested this with [PHPSpec](http://phpspec.net). Just run `composer update` and `phpspec run` to see all the test cases.
